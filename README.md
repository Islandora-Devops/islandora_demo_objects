## About

Sample objects for Islandora that demonstrate the capabilities of Islandora. These are the objects and metadata that populate the Islandora Sandbox. 

## Usage

Import the demo objects using [Islandora Workbench](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench) using the included .yml and .csv files.

## Workbench

These objects can be ingested using [Islandora Workbench](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench), a "command-line tool that allows creation, updating, and deletion of Islandora content from CSV data." The repository includes a .yml configuration file and a .csv metadata file for use with Workbench. If you have encountered a version of Workbench that does not work with this repository, please alert us so that we can update this repository.

## Starter Site

The metadata is designed to work with the fields in the Islandora Starter Site. As those fields change, this repository will need to be updated. Please alert us if you encouter field errors.

## Spreadsheet

The enclosed .csv file is maintained in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DV0Ka0ZafZq3RgCn0x_AetFtlmnMuNFltzck2QL0ApY/edit#gid=2042408311) to make it easier to view and manipulate. Once edits are made, the main sheet must be downloaded as .csv and checked in to this repository.

## Updating the Sandbox

The Islandora Sandbox will not automatically use newer versions of this repository. Any changes (to objects or metadata or configuration) must be checked into this repository, and the commit (as well as its hash) updated in the [Sandbox](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/sandbox)'s repository. There are instructions for updating in the [README](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/sandbox/blob/main/README.md#updating)https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/sandbox/blob/main/README.md#updating.
