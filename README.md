# Repository of Sample Islandora Objects

Sample objects for Islandora. These are the objects and metadata that populate the Islandora Sandbox. 

## Usage

Import the demo objects using [Islandora Workbench](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench) using the included .yml file and .csv files.

## Updates

The [Sandbox](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/sandbox) makes use of this repository and the create_islandora_objects.csv file (it has its own .yml file). However, the sandbox is locked to a specific commit of this repository and will not get updates until you update the specified commit hash, SHA-256 hash, and cut a release of the Sandbox. Full instructions are in the README of the above-linked Sandbox repo.
