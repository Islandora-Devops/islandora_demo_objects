# Repository of Sample Islandora Objects

Storing objects for the Islandora Sandbox. 

## About this Repository

Demo objects in sandbox.islandora.ca are ingested using [Islandora Workbench](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench), a "command-line tool that allows creation, updating, and deletion of Islandora content from CSV data." This spreadsheet is maintained in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DV0Ka0ZafZq3RgCn0x_AetFtlmnMuNFltzck2QL0ApY/edit#gid=2042408311) to make it easier to view and manipulate. Once edits are made, the main sheet is downloaded as .csv and then applied to the nightly build of Sandbox.
